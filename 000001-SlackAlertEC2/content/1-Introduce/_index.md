This architecture leverages the power of AWS CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, and Slack to create a seamless, automated monitoring and alerting system. The solution is designed to continuously monitor key performance metrics such as CPU utilization and disk usage on Amazon EC2 instances. When predefined thresholds are breached, indicating potential issues such as high CPU load or nearly full disk space, the system automatically triggers alerts.

Together, these services form an automated, serverless alerting pipeline:

1. CloudWatch Alarms continuously monitor EC2 instances for high CPU usage and disk space utilization.
2. When a threshold is breached, the CloudWatch alarm triggers a Lambda function.
3. The Lambda function processes the alarm event and sends a formatted notification to a specified Slack channel using a webhook.
